            We’re the kind of couple who talk nonstop, laugh at things only we find funny, and genuinely love being around each other. We’re partners in the truest sense: authentic, loving, and effortlessly in sync. Even after six years, we’re still as captivated by each other as we were at sixteen.<br><br>
            As we count down the days to our marriage, our hope is that it keeps feeling like this. That we continue loving each other as we do now: wholeheartedly, easily, and with unending joy. As we continue to grow and change, we can't wait to fall in love with the new versions of each other, again and again.

            <h2>His Story</h2>
            <p>Ethan’s someone who genuinely loves connecting with people. Whether he’s meeting someone new or spending time with people he’s known forever, he’s in his element when he’s building real connections.<br><br>
                He grew up in Lake Zurich, Illinois (just like Emma) and is the oldest of two brothers. These days, he’s working toward his master’s in Higher Education Administration at George Mason University and serving as a Graduate Residential Coordinator on campus. He's excited to go into a career where he can make an impact on students' lives and college experiences.<br><br>
                Emma would describe Ethan as easygoing, thoughtful, and incredibly nostalgic. He loves Minecraft and Mario Kart, and he’s a total sucker for a throwback movie night. He played cello and sang in choir growing up, so music has always had a place in his life. While Ethan loves classical music, car rides with Emma have added a bit more pop to his playlists.<br><br>
                Ethan’s slowly introducing Emma to the movies he can’t believe she’s never seen (he’s found she’ll agree to watch as long as he makes popcorn). But more than anything, he loves spending quality time with her. Whether it’s a long walk, a drive, or a Minecraft session on the couch where they can catch up for hours, those moments together are what he cherishes most.<br><br>
